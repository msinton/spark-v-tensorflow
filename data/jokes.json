They were all brought to the same emergency room, but all three of them died before they arrived.\n\nJust as they were about to put the toe tag on the American, he stirred and opened his eyes. Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.\n\n\"Well,\" said the American, \"I remember the crash, and then there was a beautiful light, and then the Canadian and the Scot and I were standing at the gate s of heaven. St. Peter approached us and said that we were all to young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to earth. So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50, and the next thing I knew I was back here.\"\n\n\"That's amazing!\" said the one of the doctors, \"But what happened to the other two?\"\n\n\"Last I saw them,\" replied the American, \"the Scot was haggling over the price and the Canadian was waiting for the government to pay his.\""

Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. \n\nThere they find a sign that reads: \"There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.\""
