Recommender Systems
===========================

This project needs to be renamed.
It is less Spark vs Tensorflow and more:

**Recommender Systems: using Spark and Tensorflow**


Goals and Purposes
==========================

At a high level the  goal of this project is to enable training and learning of
Data Engineering techniques especially Spark. However, in order to achieve
this we have some more concrete goals defined below.

1. **Insight into Recommender Systems**
    - Recommender systems have a huge range of applications and can be built
  using a number of Machine Learning/ Data Analysis techniques.
  Here we explore and contrast some of the techniques on a number of Datasets.

2. **Adaptive Learning**
    - a) A system should take new feedback (e.g. from User interaction) and learn from this. Ideally the model
  should be able to immediately improve so that it can react to the User - otherwise
  our *intelligent* system may seem dumb.
    - b) When a new item is added (e.g. new movie released) a recommender system should

3. **Performance**
    - Taking into account goal **2.** the system should not take so long in
    providing the recommendations that the User could lose interest. A common
    usage of recommender systems is in reactive Web applications.

### Auxiliary Goals

These goals are not the main focus but may complement/ enhance the main goals.

- Spark expertise
    - In-depth knowledge of how to manipulate and process data using Spark

- Machine Learning libraries
    - Other ML libraries than Spark's such as Tensorflow can be used and
     contrasted - often alongside spark but also separately.

- Generative models
    - We are interested in using ML to generate content - this may spawn
     into a separate project.
