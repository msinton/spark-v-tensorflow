- comparison of Sparks ML and Tensorflow
    - compare like for like (Spark has limited functionality)
    - compare ease of use
    - performance
    - flexibility
    - case study: do something simple using both


- recruitment
    - Offer or not - based on audio

- chat bot game
    - goals to get it to say 'x'

- board game recommender system
    -  need data from BoardGameGeek

- short script (play/sketch) generator
    - has been done, but still an interesting challenge
    - learns from other scripts how to produce its own
    - best done on a particular genre e.g. Sci-fi

- bridge builder
    - given starting points a, b. Connect the 2 under simulation with laws of physics
    - need to find a suitable physics simulator

- Maths generator
    - create bad maths that looks like real maths!

- email game
    - there is a large corpus of email data from a company "Enron"
    - dataset: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/
    - generator system that models the corruption
    - game is to send emails as in a normal job but to identify the 'corrupt group'

- chatbots with specific personalities
    - e.g. use twitter data filtered by a social group / particular words
    - experiment with bot talking to bot

- recommender system based on twitter data
    -

- political leaning predictor
    - need to think what data to base it on

- survival regression
    - e.g. how long till a component will fail (like a washing machine)

- beat the spam filter
    - as with images that can be tweaked to fool the classification engine
    - can we tweak genuine spam so that it gets past google's spam filter?
    - interesting but maybe too many variables...

- joke generator
    - dataset: http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/
    - can start with a recommender system
